# Visual Studio Code Installation (Optional)

I do recommend using Visual Code for code editing and working with this lab/workshop.

## Windows
Recommend to use the Windows Package Manager [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), its great!
- Once you have this configured, run the below:
```powershell
choco install vscode
```

## Mac
Recommend to use the Mac Package Manager [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/)
- Once you have this configured, run the below:
```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

## Recomended VSCode extensions

The [HashiCorp Terraform Extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform) with the Terraform Language Server adds editing features for Terraform files such as syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, code navigation, code formatting, module explorer and much more!
